# Reflection

## If I had more time
- **Challenge Question**: "If I had more time: What is the one area of this design you would flesh out in more detail, and why?"

- **Primary Focus Area**: 
  - I would run through the comprehensive questionnaire to understand **what we're actually building and why**
  - The table with questions and some current assumptions is provided in [04-questions.md](./ADR/04-questions.md) - "Questions for Stakeholder Input & Our Assumptions"
  - **Focus on business context first**: What problem are we solving? Who are our users? What's the business model?

- **Why This Area**: 
  - **Business value over technical complexity**: We need to understand the real business problem before building solutions
  - **Avoid over-engineering**: Without business context, we risk building fancy solutions that don't solve real problems
  - **Focus on outcomes**: What does success look like for the business? What metrics matter?
  - **Resource allocation**: Understanding business priorities helps us focus development efforts where they matter most

- **Business Impact**: 
  - **Real problem validation**: Are we solving the right problem? Is there actual demand?
  - **Market fit**: Who are our customers? What do they actually need?
  - **Revenue model**: How do we make money? What's the pricing strategy?
  - **Competitive advantage**: What makes us different? Why would customers choose us?

- **Technical Depth**: 
  - **Technology serves business**: Once we understand the business, we can choose the right technology
  - **Avoid premature optimization**: Don't build for 50K RPS if we need 5K RPS
  - **Practical solutions**: Choose technologies that solve real problems, not just because they're cool
  - **Maintainability**: Business context helps us choose technologies the team can actually maintain

- **Risks of Proceeding Without Business Context**:
  - **Building the wrong thing**: Solving a problem that doesn't exist
  - **Over-engineering**: Building complex solutions for simple problems
  - **Wasted resources**: Spending time on features that don't create value
  - **Market failure**: Building something nobody wants to pay for

- **Next Steps with Business Context**:
  - **Week 1**: Understand the business problem and target market
  - **Week 2**: Validate assumptions about customer needs
  - **Week 3**: Define success metrics and business outcomes
  - **Week 4**: Choose technology that serves the business, not the other way around

<!-- ## AI coding assistance
- **Challenge Question**: "AI coding assistance: If you used tools like Copilot or ChatGPT to help generate the OpenAPI spec or other parts of the design, what worked well and what did not?"
- **What Worked Well**: [What worked well when using AI tools? What specific use cases were most effective?]
- **What Didn't Work**: [What didn't work well or required manual intervention? What were the limitations?]
- **Quality Impact**: [How did AI assistance impact the quality and speed of the design? What were the trade-offs?]
- **Best Practices**: [What patterns emerged for effective AI tool usage? What would you recommend to others?]
- **Tool Selection**: [Which AI tools were most valuable for different aspects of the design? Why?] -->
