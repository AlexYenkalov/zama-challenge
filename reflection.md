# Reflection

## If I had more time
- **Challenge Question**: "If I had more time: What is the one area of this design you would flesh out in more detail, and why?"
- **Primary Focus Area**: 
  - I would run through the comprehensive questionnaire to understand our constraints and goals better.
  - The table with all the questions and some current assumptions is provided above, look up for "Questions for Stakeholder Input & Our Assumptions".
- **Why This Area**: Sufficient context is critical to make good enough decisions and get the ball rolling.
- **Business Impact**: Having sufficient context helps to cut through the noise, avoid over-engineering, and deliver real business value to clients.
- **Technical Depth**: I would like to gather understanding of what we really sell in the given case and how we can deliver it to the client in the fastest way possible.

<!-- ## AI coding assistance
- **Challenge Question**: "AI coding assistance: If you used tools like Copilot or ChatGPT to help generate the OpenAPI spec or other parts of the design, what worked well and what did not?"
- **What Worked Well**: [What worked well when using AI tools? What specific use cases were most effective?]
- **What Didn't Work**: [What didn't work well or required manual intervention? What were the limitations?]
- **Quality Impact**: [How did AI assistance impact the quality and speed of the design? What were the trade-offs?]
- **Best Practices**: [What patterns emerged for effective AI tool usage? What would you recommend to others?]
- **Tool Selection**: [Which AI tools were most valuable for different aspects of the design? Why?] -->
